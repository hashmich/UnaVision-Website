        In Germany, one hour east of Berlin, the first UnaVillage is emerging around the
        former Herzershof estate.
        UnaVillages are laboratories of future living, where regional networked communities
        live and work together.
        We would like to invite you for a workshop at Herzershof, to create resilient and
        inspiring concepts for the place.
    </p>
    <p>
        The objective is to create comprehensive space plans for the location.
        Concepts should consider residents, the new eco-village community and visitors,
        all working, living and learning together.
        A neighbouring 20ha land and nearby concrete slabs housing with 160 apartments
        should be considered in the results.
        The new eco-village will be built with natural materials, gardens follow permaculture principles.
        Resulting designs may comprise co-working spaces, workshops, a farmers market or regional caf√©.
        Invited for the Vision-Lab are all interested people such as Architects,
        landscape designers, regional planners, artists, designers and
        finally visionaries of all fields.
